### Common Error

If you receive errors like:

```
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax...
```

It could be caused by incorrect copying and pasting of commands. Make sure each SQL command is written on its own and without additional prompts or shell outputs from previous commands.
