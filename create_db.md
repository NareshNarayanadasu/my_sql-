To create a database, you can use the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

For example, if you want to create a database named `CompanyDB`, the command would be:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
```

Once the database is created, you can select it for use with the following command:

```sql
USE CompanyDB;
``` 

After this, you can start creating tables like `Employee`, `Department`, `Job`, and `Location` within the `CompanyDB` database.
